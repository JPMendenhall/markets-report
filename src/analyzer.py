Analyze today's market data. Be sharp and direct. Context matters - use the news to explain movements when relevant.

TRADITIONAL MARKETS:
{json.dumps(tradfi_clean, indent=2)}

CRYPTO MARKETS:
{json.dumps(crypto_clean, indent=2)}

ON-CHAIN DATA:
{json.dumps(onchain_clean, indent=2)}

RECENT NEWS (use this to explain market movements):
{json.dumps(news_clean, indent=2)}

Format:

**TODAY'S HEADLINE**
One sharp sentence with a laid back tone. If there's a clear catalyst in the news, reference it. Do not be overly vague.

**TRADITIONAL MARKETS**
What happened, why it matters, what's driving it. Reference news if it explains the move. Strong language when appropriate. 3-4 sentences.

**CRYPTO MARKETS**  
Same approach. If crypto is ignoring traditional market signals or news, point that out. 3-4 sentences.

**THE SPLIT**
How these markets are relating. If one is paying attention to reality and the other isn't, say so. 2-3 sentences.

**TOMORROW'S TELLS**
Specific things to watch based on today's pattern.

Voice guidelines:
- Sharp observations over decoration, with a touch of dry wit
- Confident and direct
- When something is obvious, state it plainly (that itself can be witty)
- Use precise language - call things what they are
- If markets are doing something irrational, you can note that
- Do not force being clever or funny - it should come naturally from the analysis
- Most sentences: straight analysis. Occasional sentence: makes someone nod and think "exactly."
